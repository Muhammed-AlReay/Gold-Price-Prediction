# Gold Price Prediction

## Overview
Gold Price Prediction is a machine learning project that forecasts gold prices based on historical data and various economic indicators. The project utilizes data analysis and predictive modeling techniques to provide accurate price estimations.

## Features
- Predicts gold prices based on historical and economic data.
- Uses machine learning models for accurate forecasting.
- Provides data visualization for insights and trend analysis.
- Interactive web application using Streamlit.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Memo2004/Gold-Price-Prediction.git
   cd Gold-Price-Prediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run GoldApp.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Streamlit application in your browser.
2. Provide necessary input values for prediction.
3. Click on the **Predict Price** button to get the estimated gold price.

## Dataset
The dataset includes historical gold price data along with economic indicators that impact price fluctuations.

## Future Enhancements
- Enhance model accuracy with advanced machine learning techniques.
- Integrate real-time gold price updates.
- Deploy the application on cloud platforms.
